###Portfolio Optimization
* Objective: Learn the fundamentals of portfolio theory and implement a basic portfolio optimization problem in Python.
* Subtasks: Retrieve stock price data: Use a financial API (e.g., Yahoo Finance with yfinance) to fetch historical stock prices for a few assets (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, TSLA).
* Calculate returns: Compute daily or monthly percentage changes in stock prices.
* Portfolio optimization: Compute the covariance matrix of the asset returns.
* Use optimization techniques (e.g., from scipy.optimize) to find the weights that minimize portfolio risk for a given expected return.
* Visualize the efficient frontier: Plot the risk-return tradeoff curve to understand the optimal allocation of assets.
